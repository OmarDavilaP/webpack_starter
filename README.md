# webpack_starter

I have created this webpack configuration to start an interna project using React, Babel and Uglify, I know there is a bounch of help out there in internet and also exist a very supported tool called create-react-app but this starter is just for learning.

please feel free to send me constructive feedback, I will really appreciate it.


here are some of the documentation I have used to build this starter.
